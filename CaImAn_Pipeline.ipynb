    "# Key parameters for CNMF...\n",
    "#### 1. rf (int): patch half-width\n",
    "\n",
    "rf ('receptive field') is the half width of patches that in pixels (the actual patch width is 2*rf + 1). See previous image for a representation of how the field of view is split up into patches for parallel procesing. rf should be at least 3-4 times larger than the observed neuron diameter. The larger the patch size, the less parallelization will be used by Caiman. If rf is set to None, then CNMF will be run on the entire field of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. stride (int): patch overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "stride is the overlap between patches in pixels (the actual overlap is stride + 1). This should be at least the diameter of a neuron. The larger the overlap, the greater the computational load, but the results will be more accurate when stitching together results from different patches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. K (int): components per patch\n",
    "\n",
    "K is the expected number of components per patch. You should adapt this to the density of components in your data, and the current rf parameter. We suggest you pick K based on the more dense patches in your movie so you don't miss neurons (we want to avoid false negatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. gSig (int, int): half-width of neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "gSig is roughly the half-width of neurons in your movie in pixels (height, width): it is the sigma parameter of a Gaussian filter run on all the images during initialization. If the filter matches the neurons, you will get a much better estimate. gSig goes with gSiz, which is the kernel size (height and width in pixels) used for the filter. See the GaussianBlur() OpenCV function for more details on the sigma and size parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "merge_thr (float): merge threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "If two spatially overlapping components are correlated above merge_thr, they will be merged into one component. The correlation coefficient is calculated using their calcium traces. If Caiman identifies a \"component\" that clearly contains two overlapping components, then increase merge_thr.\n",
    "\n",
    "You typically will set rf and stride infrequently, so K, gSig, and merge_thr are the main parameters you will tweak when analyzing a given session. Note these are not the only important parameters. They just tend to be the most important: the others tend to depend on your calcium indicator or other factors that don't vary within an experimental session.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### all parameters\n",
    "- `fnames`: List of paths to the file(s) to be analysed. Memmap and hdf5 result files will be saved in the same directory.\n",
    "- `fr`: Imaging frame rate in frames per second.\n",
    "- `decay_time`: Length of a typical transient in seconds. decay_time is an approximation of the time scale over which to expect a significant shift in the calcium signal during a transient. It defaults to 0.4, which is appropriate for fast indicators (GCaMP6f), slow indicators might use 1 or even more. However, decay_time does not have to precisely fit the data, approximations are enough.\n",
    "- `p`: Order of the autoregressive model. p = 0 turns deconvolution off. If transients in your data rise instantaneously, set p = 1 (occurs at low sample rate or slow indicator). If transients have visible rise time, set p = 2. If the wrong order is chosen, spikes are extracted unreliably.\n",
    "- `nb`: Number of global background components. This is a measure of the complexity of your background noise. Defaults to nb = 2, assuming a relatively homogeneous background. nb = 3 might fit for more complex noise, nb = 1 is usually too low. If nb is set too low, extracted traces appear too noisy, if nb is set too high, neuronal signal starts getting absorbed into the background reduction, resulting in reduced transients.\n",
    "- `merge_thr`: Merging threshold of components after initialization. If two components are correlated more than this value (e.g. when during initialization a neuron was split in two components), they are merged and treated as one.\n",
    "- `rf`: Half-size of the patches in pixels. Should be at least 3 to 4 times larger than the expected neuron size to capture the complete neuron and its local background. Larger patches lead to less parallelization.\n",
    "- `stride`: Overlap between patches in pixels. This should be roughly the neuron diameter. Larger overlap increases computational load, but yields better results during reconstruction/denoising of the data.\n",
    "- `K`: Number of (expected) components per patch. Adapt to rf and estimated component density.\n",
    "- `gSig`: Expected half-size of neurons in pixels [rows X columns]. CRUCIAL parameter for proper component detection.\n",
    "- `gSig_filt`: The size of the kernel is given from the parameter `gSig_filt`. Motion correction performs the best when `gSig_filt` is same with `gSig`. If this is left to the default value of `None` then no spatial filtering is performed (default option, used in 2p data).\n",
    "- `method_init`: Initialization method, depends mainly on the recording method. Use greedy_roi for 2p data, corr_pnr for 1p data, and sparse_nmf for dendritic/axonal data.\n",
    "- `ssub/tsub`: Spatial and temporal subsampling during initialization. Defaults to 1 (no compression). Can be set to 2 or even higher to save resources, but might impair detection/extraction quality.\n"

In other words, the large-scale background model used for CNMF is not sufficient for most 1p data. Hence, Pengcheng Zhou and others came up with a localized model of background activity for CNMFE: the background at each pixel is represented as the weighted sum of activity from a circle (or ring) of pixels a certain distance from that pixel. The distance of this ring from the reference pixel is set by the <em>ring_size_factor</em> parameter. This more complex pixel-by-pixel background model explains why CNMFE is computationally more expensive than CNMF, and also why it works better to mop up large-scale localized background noise in  1p data. \n",

This mean centering creates a Gaussian with a positive peak in the middle of width <i>approximately</i> <em>gSig/2</em>, surrounded by a negative trench, and a ledge of zeros around the outer edges. This crucial preprocessing filter serves to highlight neuronal peaks and smooth away low-frequency background activity.\n",

The PNR is the ratio of the maximum magnitude at a pixel to the noise value at that pixel (it is a fast and rough measure of signal-to-noise). As mentioned above, both of these values tend to be higher in pixels that contain neurons.
